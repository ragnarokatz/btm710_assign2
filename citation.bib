   abstract = {The development of virtual reality (VR) technology has greatly changed various industries, and medicine field is not exceptional too. This paper briefly introduces application of VR from two aspects. The application in theoretical teaching is virtual anatomy and virtual human projects have been widely researched in various universities and institutions all over the world, which will give medical students a more realistic visual sense compared to the traditional teaching methods with 2-D diagrams. And VR surgical system plays an important role in clinical practice training, which provides surgeons a simulation environment with vivid visual, auditory, haptic senses, it will be an excellent substitute of cadaver because residents and interns can repeat all kinds of operations in the system without limits.},

abstract = {Several financial and banking sector reform programs were instituted in different countries over the last three decades. The underlining purpose of these reforms was largely to improve banking sector supervision and regulation, introduce bank privatization mechanism, introduce clearance and settlement systems, infuse competition and to stimulate financial innovation. The objectives of this study are to 1) review the relevant published literature and market survey reports on the financial & banking sector reforms undertaken in Pakistan and elsewhere, 2) analyze how these reform programs develop digital banking culture and increase financial inclusion in the country and 3) guide future research by putting forward a research agenda. The findings of the study suggest a link between the financial and banking sector reforms and the stimulation of financial innovation; the promotion of digital banking culture; and the infusion of financial inclusion in Pakistan. We discuss managerial/policy implications of the study, limitations and presents recommendations for future research.}

abstract = {This paper reports the use, in the UK Home Office Prison Department, of cognitive mapping techniques for policy analysis. The methodology used has been developed to facilitate more effective management of messy problems by management teams. Here it is used for the collation, comparison and analysis of the views of many experts in relation to a major policy issue. The analysis makes use of the specially designed computer software, Decision Explorer. The paper discusses the impact of the approach and suggests general implications for the way in which policy analysis is conducted.}
